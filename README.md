# My Agentic AI Project from Watsonx.ai

This project is an AI agent named FitSide which is developed using IBM's Watsonx.ai platform. It is designed to act as an AI-powered health and fitness 
coach.

## Description
Fitness Buddy is an AI-powered chatbot designed to act as a personal fitness and health companion, providing on-demand, personalized guidance to make a healthy lifestyle more accessible and sustainable.

The primary purpose of Fitness Buddy is to address the common barriers to maintaining a healthy lifestyle: a lack of personalized guidance, time constraints, and inconsistent motivation. Traditional fitness solutions are often expensive, rigid, or require in-person consultations. Fitness Buddy serves as an intelligent, friendly, and accessible virtual coach that fits into the user's pocket and daily routine.

The project's vision is to empower individuals, especially beginners and those with busy schedules, to take control of their health by providing simple, actionable, and encouraging support 24/7. It aims to build user confidence and foster long-term healthy habits through a conversational and non-judgmental interface.
